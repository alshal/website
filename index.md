A lecturer at <a href="https://www.scu.edu/cas/physics/">the Department of Physics, Santa Clara University</a>, interested in theoretical & mathematical physics, particularly gravitational theories. My Ph.D. research was supervised by Prof. T. L. Curtright at University of Miami, where I studied massive dual gravity. Major part of my Ph.D. research is summarized in an essay I coauthored, which received <a href="https://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/s/2021-GRF-Abstracts.pdf">Honorable Mention in the 2021 Gravity Research Foundation competition</a>. Also, I do research on generalized uncertainty principle, black holes, wormholes, entropy & information geometry, and alternative theories of general relativity.
