A lecturer at <a href="https://www.scu.edu/cas/physics/">the Department of Physics, Santa Clara University</a>, interested in theoretical & mathematical physics, particularly gravitational theories. My Ph.D. research was supervised by Prof. T. L. Curtright at University of Miami, where I studied massive dual gravity. I do research on generalized uncertainty principle, black holes, wormholes, entropy & information geometry, and alternative theories of general relativity. My profile captures skills in biophysics too. I assimilate modeling experiences from theoretical physics, programming skills (Python mainly), besides chemical and biological subject fields I studied while I was pursuing my other B.Sc. degree in pharmaceutical sciences.
